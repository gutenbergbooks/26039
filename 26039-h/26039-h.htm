<h2><a name="TO_MY_CHILDREN" id="TO_MY_CHILDREN"></a>TO MY CHILDREN.</h2>


<p>I dedicate this story to you, because it was for you I first wrote it, and to
you I first read it among the green hills of Moffat. It was afterwards printed
in <em>Good Words</em>, and now you see it again appears as a little book for other
children, who, I hope, will like it as much as you do.</p>

<p>I wish to help and encourage you, and all who read this story, to learn the
great lesson which it is intended to teach; that lesson is, that we should
always trust God and do what is right, and thus hold fast our
gold thread
in spite of every temptation and danger, being certain that in this way only
will God lead us in safety and peace to His home.</p>

<p>Now, God gives each of you this gold thread to hold fast in your own house or
in school, in the nursery or in the play-ground, on every day and in every
place. His voice in your heart, and in His Word, will also tell you always what
is right, if you only listen to it. You, too, will be constantly tempted in some
way or other to give up your gold thread, and to be selfish, disobedient, lazy,
or untruthful. Many things, in short, will tempt you to do your own will rather
than God's will.</p>

<p>You already know, and I hope you will always love and remember, those true
stories in the Bible about the good men of the olden time, whose lives are there
written. Now, what shewed that they were good? It was this, that <em>they trusted
God, and did what was right</em>. If they ever let this their
gold thread go, they lost their way and became unhappy; but when they held it
fast, it led them in a way of peace and safety. To see how true this is, you
have only to recall such stories as those of Noah, Abraham, Joseph, Moses, Job,
Caleb and Joshua, Samuel, David and Jonathan, Elijah and Elisha, Hezekiah,
Jeremiah, Daniel and his three companions, &amp;c., &amp;c., with those told you in the
Book of Acts, not to mention the history of Jesus Christ, the perfect example
for us all.</p>

<p>That you, my dear children, may be &quot;followers of those who through faith and
patience now inherit the promises,&quot; and thus be &quot;followers of God as dear
children,&quot; is the constant prayer of your mother, and of your father,</p>

<h3>THE WANDERER&#8212;WOLF THE SWINEHERD.</h3>


<p>
<img class="figleft" alt="Illustration 1" src="images/fig-01.jpg" width="253" height="600"  /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NCE upon a time, a boy lost his way in a vast forest that filled many a
valley, and passed over many a hill, a rolling sea of leaves for miles and
miles, further than the eye could reach. His name was Eric, son of the good King
Magnus. He was dressed in a blue velvet dress, with a gold band round his waist,
and his fair locks in silken curls waved from his beautiful head. But his hands and face were scratched, and his clothes torn
with the briars, as he ran here and there like one much perplexed. Sometimes he
made his way through tangled brushwood, or crossed the little grassy plains in
the forest, now losing himself in dark ravines, then climbing up their steep
sides, or crossing with difficulty the streams that hurried through them. For a
long time he kept his heart up, and always said to himself, &quot;I shall find it, I
shall find it;&quot; until, as the day advanced, he was wearied and hungry; and every
now and then he cried, &quot;Oh, my father! where is my father! I'm lost! I'm lost!&quot;
Or, &quot;Where, oh, where is my gold thread!&quot; All day the forest seemed to him to be
very sad. He had never seen it so gloomy. There was a strange sadness in the
rustle of the leaves, and a sadness in the noise of the streams. He did not hear
the birds sing as they used to do. But he heard the ravens croak with their
hoarse voice, as their black forms swept along the precipices which here and
there rose above the trees. The large hawks, too, always appeared to be wheeling over his head, pausing, and fluttering as
if about to dart down upon him. Why was he so sad? Why was he so afraid?</p>

<p>But on Eric journeyed, in the hope of finding his way out of the boundless
forest, or of meeting some one who would be his guide. At last, the sun appeared
to be near its setting, and he could see the high branches of the trees, shining
like gold, as its last rays fell upon them. But underneath, the foliage was
getting darker and darker; the birds were preparing to sleep, and everything
soon became so still that he could hear his steps echoing through the wood, and
when he stopped, he heard his heart beating, or a leaf falling; but nowhere did
he see a house, and no human being had he met since morning. Then the wind
suddenly began to rise, and he heard it at first creeping along the tree-tops
like a gentle whisper, and by and by to call louder and louder for the storm to
come. Dark clouds gathered over the sky, and rushed along chased by the winds,
that were soon to fight with the giant trees.</p>

<p>At last, he sat down at the root of a great old oak, burying his face in his hands, not knowing what to do. He
then tried to climb the tree, in order to spend the night among its branches, in
case wild beasts should attack him. But as he was climbing it, he heard some one
singing with a loud voice. Listening attentively, and looking eagerly through
the leaves, he saw a boy apparently older than himself, dressed in rough shaggy
clothes, made from skins of wild animals. His long matted hair escaped over his
cheeks from under a black bearskin cap. With a short thick stick he was driving
a herd of swine through the wood. &quot;Hey there, you black porker!&quot; cried the boy,
as he threw a stone at some pig which was running away. &quot;Get along, you lazy
long-snout!&quot; he shouted to another, as he came thump on its back with his
cudgel. And then he sung this song with a loud voice which made the woods ring:&#8212;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>
"Oh, there's nothing half so fine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As to drive a herd of swine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And through the forest toddle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With nothing in my noddle,</span><br />
But rub-a-dub, rub-dub, hey-up, halloo!<br />
<br />
"When I wish to have some fun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then I make the porkers run,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Till they gallop, snort, and wheeze,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Among the leafy trees;</span><br />
Oh, rub-a-dub, rub-dub, hey-up, halloo!<br />
<br />
"How their backs begin to bristle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When I shout aloud and whistle!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">How they kick at every lick</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That I give them with my stick!</span><br />
Oh, rub-a-dub, rub-dub, hey-up, halloo!"<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&quot;Get along, you rascals,&quot; cried the savage-looking herd, &quot;or I'll kill and
roast you before your time.&quot; But soon the herd, with his swine, were concealed
from Eric's sight by the wood; though he still heard his &quot;rub-a-dub&quot; chorus, to
which he beat time with a sort of rude drum, made with a dried skin and hoop.
Eric determined to make his acquaintance, or at all events to follow him to some
house; so he descended from the tree, and ran off in the direction from which he
heard the song coming. He soon over-took him.</p>

<p class="center">
<img class="figcenter" alt="Figure 2" src="images/fig-02.jpg" width="400" height="564" />&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Hollo!&quot; said the wild-looking lad, with as much astonishment as if Eric had
fallen from
the clouds: &quot;Who? where from? where to?&quot; &quot;I have lost my way in the wood,&quot; said
Eric, &quot;and want you to guide me.&quot; &quot;To Ralph?&quot; asked the swineherd. &quot;Ralph! pray,
who is he?&quot; &quot;Master, chief, captain, everything, everybody,&quot; replied the young
savage. &quot;I will go anywhere for shelter, as night is coming on; but I will
reward you if you bring me to my father's home.&quot; &quot;Who is your father, my fine
fellow?&quot; inquired the swineherd, leaning on his stick. &quot;The king,&quot; replied Eric.
&quot;You lie, Sir Prince! Ralph is king.&quot; &quot;I speak the truth, swineherd.&quot; The
swineherd by this time was examining Eric's dress with an impudent look. &quot;Pay me
now,&quot; said he; &quot;give me this gold band, and I will guide you.&quot; &quot;I cannot give
you this gold band, for my father gave it to me, and I have lost enough to-day.
By the by, did you see a gold thread waving anywhere among the trees?&quot; &quot;A gold
thread! what do you mean? I saw nothing but pigs until I saw you, and I shall
treat you like a pig, d'ye hear? and lick you too, for I have no time to put
off. So give me your
band. Come, be quick!&quot; said he, with his fierce face, and holding up his stick
as he came up to Eric. &quot;Keep off, swineherd; don't touch me!&quot; &quot;Don't touch you!
why shouldn't I touch you? Do you see this stick? How would you like to have it
among your fine curls, as I drive it among the pigs' bristles?&quot; And he began to
flourish it over his head, and to press nearer and nearer. &quot;Once, twice, when I
say thrice, if you do not unbuckle, I shall save you the trouble, and leave you
to the wild beasts, who would like a tender bit of prince's flesh better than
pork. Come; once! twice!&quot; Eric was on his guard, and said, &quot;I shall fight you,
you young robber, till death, rather than give you this band,&#8212;so keep off.&quot;
&quot;Thrice!&quot; shouted the herd, and down came his thick cudgel, which he intended
should fall on Eric's head. But Eric sprang aside, and before he could recover
himself, dashed in upon him, tripped him up, and threw him on the grass, seizing
him by the throat in a moment. The herd, in his efforts to get out of Eric's
grasp, let go his cudgel, which Eric seized, and held over his head. &quot;Unless you promise, Master Swineherd, to leave me
alone, I may leave <em>you</em> alone with the wild beasts.&quot; &quot;You are stronger than I
thought,&quot; said the herd. &quot;Let me up, or I shall be choked. Let me up, I say, and
I promise to guide you.&quot; &quot;I shall trust you,&quot; said Eric, &quot;though you would not
trust me. Rise!&quot; So the herd rose, and picked up his cap, but Eric would not
give him his stick until he guided him to some house. &quot;Come along,&quot; said he,
sulkily. &quot;What is your name?&quot; asked Eric. &quot;They call me Wolf. I killed a wolf
once with my boar-spear.&quot; &quot;Why, Wolf, did you try to kill me?&quot; &quot;Because I wanted
your gold belt.&quot; &quot;But it is a great sin to rob and kill.&quot; &quot;Other people rob me,
and would kill me too, if I did not take care of their pigs,&quot; said Wolf,
carelessly. &quot;You should fear God, Wolf.&quot; &quot;I fear that name truly, for Ralph
always swears by it when he is in a rage. But I do not know what it means.&quot; &quot;Oh,
Wolf, surely your father and mother told you about God, who made all things, and
made you and me; God, who loves us, and wishes us to love Him, and to do what is right?&quot; &quot;I have
no father or mother,&quot; replied Wolf, &quot;nor brothers or sisters, and I do not know
God. No one cares for me but my pigs, and so I sleep with them, and eat with
them.&quot; &quot;Poor fellow!&quot; said Eric with a look of kindness, &quot;I am sorry for you.
Here is all the money I have. Take it. I wish to shew you that I have no
ill-will to you;&quot; and Eric gave him a gold coin. Wolf gave a grunt like one of
his pigs, and began his song of &quot;Rub-a-dub.&quot; &quot;No one ever gave me money before,&quot;
remarked Wolf almost to himself, as he examined the coin on his rough hand,
which looked like tanned leather. &quot;How much is this?&quot; inquired Wolf. Eric
explained its value. The herd was astonished, and began to think what he could
purchase with it. &quot;It would buy a large pig,&quot; he said. He seemed very anxious to
conceal the coin, and so he hid it in the top of his hairy cap. &quot;See that tall
tower,&quot; said Wolf, &quot;which looks like a rock above the trees; that is the only
house near for twenty miles round. You can reach it soon; and when you do reach it,&quot; said Wolf, speaking low, as if some
one might hear him, &quot;take my advice, and get away as fast as you can from my
master Ralph, for&quot;&#8212;and Wolf gave a number of winks, as much as to say, I know
something. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Eric. &quot;Oh, nothing, nothing; but take
Wolf's advice, and say to Ralph you are a beggar. Put the gold band in your
pocket, and swear to remain with him, but run off when you can. Cheat him;
that's my way.&quot; &quot;It is not my way,&quot; replied Eric, &quot;and, come what may, never can
be, for a voice says to me,</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>
"'Better to die<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Than ever to lie.'"</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&quot;Ha! ha!&quot; said Wolf; &quot;I wish you lived with Ralph. He would teach you another
lesson, my lad.&quot; &quot;I would rather that I had you, Wolf, to live in my house. I
would be kind to you, and help you to be good, and tell you about God, who lives
in the sky.&quot; &quot;And is that He who is speaking? Listen!&quot; Thunder began to mutter
in the clouds. &quot;Yes, it is He,&quot; replied Eric; &quot;and if you will only listen, you
can also
hear Him often speak with a small, still voice in your heart.&quot; &quot;I never heard
Him,&quot; replied Wolf; &quot;but I cannot stay longer with you, for my pigs will wander:
there is a black rascal who always leads them astray. Now, king's son, give Wolf
the stick; it is all he has.&quot; &quot;Here it is to you, and I am sure you will not use
it wrongly; you will try and be good, Wolf? for it will make you happy.&quot;
&quot;Humph,&quot; said Wolf, &quot;I am happy when I get my pigs home, and Ralph does not
strike me. But I must away, and see you don't tell any one you gave me money.
They would rob me.&quot; And away he ran among the trees in search of his pigs, while
Eric heard his little drum, and his song of &quot;Rub-a-dub, halloo!&quot; die away in the
distance. Another loud peal and flash of lightning made Eric start, and off he
ran towards a light which now beamed from the tower. But he thought to himself,
&quot;I am much worse than that poor Wolf, for I knew what was right, and did not do
it. I heard the voice, but did not attend to it. Oh, my father, why did I not
obey you!&quot;</p>

<h3>THE ROBBER'S TOWER.</h3>


<p>
<img class="figleft" alt="Illustration 3" src="images/fig-03.jpg" width="166" height="500" /></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Sometimes he lost sight of the light, and again he caught it, till it became
brighter and brighter, and very soon he came to a high rock, on the top of which
was perched a tall, dark tower. After groping about, he found a narrow path that
led up to the tower, from one of the windows of which the light was brightly
shining. He ascended
a flight of steep steps till he reached a massive door covered with iron. He
knocked as loud as he could, when a large dog began barking furiously inside,
and springing up to the door, as if it would tear it down. Then a gruff voice
called out of a window over the door, &quot;Who is there? Who disturbs me in this
way?&quot; The little boy replied, &quot;Please, sir, I am Eric, son of King Magnus, and I
have lost my way in this wood.&quot; &quot;The son of the king, are you?&quot; asked the voice.
&quot;That is a grand joke! Let me have a sight of you.&quot; Then the window was shut,
and he heard footsteps coming tramp, tramp, down the stairs, and the voice said
to the dog, &quot;Lie down, hound, and don't be greedy! You would not eat a young
prince, would you? Lie down, Tuscar!&quot; The door was then opened by a
fierce-looking man, with a long beard. The man bid him enter, and examined him
about himself and his journey. Eric answered truly every question. Then the man
rang a bell for an old woman who lived in the house, and bid her take the boy
with her, and give him his supper. The old woman looked very ugly and very cross, and led
him up, up, a great number of dark, gloomy stairs, until she reached a small
room, with a bed and table in it, where she bade Eric wait till she brought him
supper. The big hound followed them, and stayed in the room while the woman went
away. Eric was at first afraid of the dog, he was so large and wild-looking, but
he came and laid his head on his knee, and he scratched his ears, and patted
him, and was very kind to him. The supper came, and the boy managed to keep a
few bits of meat out of his own supper for the dog, and when the old woman went
out of the room, he fed the hound, who seemed very hungry, and said to him,
&quot;Tuscar, old fellow, I like you very much. Take another bit, good dog, and be
happy!&quot; The dog wagged his tail, and looked up kindly with his large eyes, for
he was thankful for his supper, and ate much more than Eric. &quot;Now,&quot; said the old
woman gruffly, when she took away the remains of the supper, &quot;you have ate what
would do me for a week. You won't starve, Master Prince. Go to bed.&quot; The old woman left him, but suddenly
returning, she discovered Eric on his knees. As he rose, she scoffed and jeered
him, and asked, &quot;Do you always say your prayers?&quot; &quot;Yes, always,&quot; replied the
boy. &quot;Who taught you?&quot; &quot;My mother, who is dead.&quot; The old woman heaved a deep
sigh, but the boy did not know why. Perhaps she used to pray when she was a
little girl herself, and had given up speaking to God, or even thinking of Him,
and so had become wicked; or perhaps she thought of some child of her own whom
she had never taught to pray. She soon went away without speaking a word more,
and Eric was left in darkness. He looked out through the narrow window of his
room, but could see nothing but black clouds rushing over the sky. Far down he
heard a stream roaring, and the wind, which now blew a gale, came booming over
the tree-tops, and howling round the tower. Every now and then a flash lighted
up the forest, and the thunder crashed in the sky. It was a fearful night!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="figcenter" alt="Illustration 4" src="images/fig-04.jpg" width="400" height="557" />
</div>

<p>&nbsp;Some time after, he heard footsteps at his door, and immediately the man with
the beard entered, and sat down. &quot;Do you know,&quot; he asked, &quot;where your father
is?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said Eric; &quot;as I told you, I lost my way in the forest, and have been
wandering all day, and cannot find him; but perhaps you will send some one
to-morrow with me to shew me the way to his castle, and I am sure my kind, good
father will give you a rich reward.&quot; &quot;You are very, very far from your father's
house,&quot; said the man, &quot;and I fear you will never see him again; but come with
me, and I shall shew you some beautiful things that will please you.&quot; So the man
took Eric by the hand, and, carrying a lamp, he led him into a room that seemed
full of gold and silver, with beautiful dresses, sparkling with diamonds, and
every kind of splendour, and he said, &quot;Stay with me, my boy, and I will give you
all this, for I am a king too, and will make you my heir.&quot; &quot;Oh, no, no,&quot; said
Eric; &quot;I will never forsake my own father.&quot; The man then said, &quot;If you stay with
me, you need
never go to school all day, but may amuse yourself from morning till night, and
have a beautiful pony to ride, and a gun to shoot deer with, and also
fishing-rods, and a servant to attend you, and any kind of meat and drink you
like best. Do stay with me!&quot; &quot;You are very kind,&quot; said Eric, &quot;but I cannot be
happy without my father.&quot; &quot;Come then with me, my fine fellow, and I shall shew
you something different,&quot; said the man, seizing Eric firmly by the arm, and
looking very angry. After walking along a passage, from the end of which
confused noises came, a door was opened, and in a large hall, round a great oak
table, sat a company of fierce-looking men, drinking from large flagons which
stood before them. Their faces were red, and their eyes gleamed like fire. Ralph
placed Eric on the table. One of the robbers was singing this song:&#8212;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>
"We're the famous robber band&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Hurrah!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em">The lords of all the land&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Hurrah!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em">A fig for law or duty,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em">If we only get our booty;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em">With a fa, lal, la, la, la!</span><br />
<br />
"'Every man to mind himself,'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Hurrah!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em">Is the rule of Captain Ralph!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Hurrah!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em">Then let the greatest thief</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em">And robber be our chief&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em">With a fa, lal, la, la, la!"</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>No wonder poor Eric trembled as he heard that lawless band thus glorying in
their shame, and like demons singing their horrid song in praise of all that was
most dreadful and most wicked. He had read stories of robbers, which sometimes
made him think that they were fine, brave fellows; but now that he was among
them, he saw how depraved, cruel, and frightful they were. Their savage, coarse
looks terrified him; but he was held by Ralph on the table. When the song was
ended, one of them asked, &quot;Whom have we got here?&quot; &quot;Who do you think?&quot; replied
Ralph. &quot;What would you say, my men, to a young prince,&#8212;no less than the son of
our great enemy, King Magnus?&quot; &quot;A young prince! The son of Magnus! What a prize!&quot; they exclaimed. &quot;What
shall we do with him?&quot; &quot;First of all, let us have his gold belt,&quot; said Ralph,
unbuckling Eric's belt. &quot;Ha! what a pretty thing it is!&quot; &quot;My father gave it to
me, and I don't wish to part with it. The swineherd Wolf tried to take it from
me, but I fought him, and kept it,&quot; said Eric. &quot;Wolf is a brave young robber,&quot;
replied Ralph, &quot;and he shall have it for his trouble. In the meantime, my lad,
it is mine. But what, my men, shall we do with the prince?&quot; &quot;Kill him,&quot; said
one. &quot;Starve him to death,&quot; said another. &quot;Put his eyes out, and send him back
to his father,&quot; said a third. Eric prayed to God, but said nothing. &quot;I propose,&quot;
said Ralph, &quot;to make him a captain if he will stay with us.&quot; &quot;Never!&quot; said Eric;
&quot;I would rather die!&quot; &quot;Let him die, then,&quot; said a fierce robber; &quot;for his father
hung my brother for killing one of his nobles.&quot; &quot;I tell you what we will do with
the lion's whelp,&quot; said Ralph; &quot;let us keep him in prison, and send a message to
his father, that we have him snug in a den among the mountains, and that, unless he sends us an immense
ransom, we shall kill him.&quot; &quot;That will do famously,&quot; said the robbers; &quot;so off
with him!&quot; Then Ralph led the boy down stairs,&#8212;down, down, until he thought they
never would stop, and at last they came to an iron door, with great bars on it,
and a large lock, and he turned to Eric, and said, &quot;I know your father, and I
hate him! for he sends his soldiers after me, and tries to save travellers from
me, and now I have got his son. I will keep you here till you die, or till he
pays!&quot; Then he opened the dungeon door, and thrust Eric in. When it closed, it
echoed like thunder through the passages. Eric cast himself down on the dungeon
floor.</p>

<p>All appeared to be a strange dream. Oh, how he repented having disobeyed his
father! and how he seemed to be as bad as the dreadful robbers in having done
what he pleased, and followed his own will, instead of doing what was right!
About an hour after, he heard some rustling, as if high up on the wall, and a
voice whispered
&quot;Eric!&quot; &quot;Who is there?&quot; asked Eric, and his little heart trembled. &quot;Silence!
quiet! it is Wolf. Here is a small window in your prison, and I have opened it
outside; climb up, get out, and run for your life.&quot; Eric heard no more, but
scrambled in the dark up the rough stones in the wall until he reached the
window, where he looked out, and saw the stars and the woods. He soon forced his
way through, and dropped down on the opposite side. Some one caught him in his
arms. It was Wolf. &quot;Here is your gold band, Eric. I got it from Ralph; for He
who was speaking in the thunder has been saying things in my heart. You were
kind to poor Wolf. Now escape! Fly! I shall close the window again. Ralph will
never know how you got out, and he will not open the prison-door till after
breakfast. So you have a long time. Run as long as you can along that road till
you reach a hill, then cross it, until you reach a stream, which you must follow
downwards. The worst of the storm is over, and the night will soon be calm.
Off!&quot; &quot;Bless you, Wolf!&quot; said Eric; &quot;I shall never forget you.&quot; Poor Eric! how he ran, and ran,
beneath the stars! He felt no fatigue for a time. He thought he heard the
robbers after him; every time the wind blew loud, he imagined it was their wild
cry. On he ran till he reached the hill, and crossed it, and came to a green
spot beneath a rock, on the banks of the stream, when he could run no more, but
fell down, and whether he fainted or fell asleep he could not tell.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Eric knew not how long he slept, but, as in a dream, he heard a sweet voice
singing these words:&#8212;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>
"Rest thee, boy, rest thee, boy, lonely and dreary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy little heart breaking from losing the way;</span><br />
Thy father has not left thee friendless, though weary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When learning through suffering to fear and obey."</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Eric opened his eyes, but moved not a limb, as if under some strange fascination. It was early
morning. High over head a lark was &quot;singing like an angel in the clouds.&quot; The
mysterious voice went on in the same beautiful and soothing strain&#8212;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>
"Oh, sweet is the lark as she sings o'er her nest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And warbles unseen in the clear morning light;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em">But sweeter by far is the song in the breast</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When in life's early morning we do what is right!"</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Eric could neither move nor speak; but in his heart he confessed with sorrow
that he had done what was wrong. And again the voice sang&#8212;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>
"Now, darling, awaken, thou art not forsaken!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The old night is past and a new day begun;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em">Let thy journey with love to thy father be taken,</span><br />

<p>&quot;I will arise and go to my father!&quot; said Eric, springing to his feet. He saw
beside him a beautiful lady, who looked like a picture he once saw of his
mother, or like one of those angels from heaven about whom he had often read.
And the lady said, &quot;Fear not! I know you, Eric, and how it came to pass that you
are here. Your father sent you for a wise and good purpose through the forest,
and gave you hold of a gold thread to guide you, and told you never to let it
go. It was your duty to him to have held it fast; but instead of doing your
duty, trusting and obeying your father, and keeping hold of the thread, you let
it go to chase butterflies, and gather wild-berries, and to amuse yourself. This
you did more than once. You neglected your father's counsels and warnings, and
because of your self-confidence and self-pleasing, you lost your thread, and
then you lost your way. What dangers and troubles have you thus got into through
disobedience to your father's commands, and want of trust in his love and
wisdom! For had you only followed your father's directions, the gold thread
would have brought you to his beautiful castle, where there is to be a happy
meeting of your friends, with all your brothers and sisters.&quot; Poor little Eric
began to weep! &quot;Listen to me, child,&quot; said the lady, kindly, &quot;for <em>you cannot have peace but by doing what
is right</em>. Know, then, that all your brothers and sisters made this very
journey by help of the gold thread, and they are at home with great joy.&quot; &quot;Oh,
save me! save me!&quot; cried Eric, and caught the lady's hand. &quot;Yes, I will save
you,&quot; said she, &quot;if you will learn obedience. I know and love you, dear boy. I
know and love your father, and have been sent by him to deliver you. I heard
what you said, and know all you did, last night, and I was very glad that you
proved, in trial, your love to your father, your love of truth, and your love of
others, and this makes me hope all good of you for the future. Come now with
me!&quot; And so the beautiful woman took him by the hand. The storm had passed away,
and the sun was shining on the green leaves of the trees, and every drop of dew
sparkled like a diamond. The birds were all warbling their morning hymns, and
feeding their young ones in their nests. The streams were dancing down the rocks
and through the glens. &quot;The mountains broke forth into singing, and all the
trees clapped their hands with joy.&quot; Everything thus seemed beautiful and happy
to Eric, for he himself was happy at the thought of doing what was right, and of
going home. The lady led him to a sunny glade in the wood, covered with wild
flowers, from which the bees were busy gathering their honey, and she said,
&quot;Now, child, are you willing to do your father's will?&quot; &quot;Oh, yes!&quot; &quot;Will you do
it, whatever dangers may await you?&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot; &quot;Well, then, I must tell you that
your father has given me the gold thread which you lost; and he bids me again
tell you, with his warm love, that if you keep hold of it, and follow it
wherever it leads, you are sure to come to him at sunset; but if you let it go,
you may wander on in this dark forest till you die, or are again taken prisoner
by robbers. Know, also, that there is no other possible way of saving you, but
by your following the gold thread.&quot; &quot;I am resolved to do my duty, come what
may,&quot; said Eric. &quot;May you be helped to do it!&quot; said the lady. She then gave him
a cake, to support him in his journey. &quot;And now, child,&quot; she added, &quot;one advice
more I will give you, and it was given you by your father, though you forgot it;
it is this&#8212;if ever you feel the thread slipping from your hands, or are yourself
tempted to let it go, pray immediately, and you will get wisdom and strength to
find it, to lay hold of it, and to follow it. Before we part, kneel down and ask
assistance to be good and obedient, brave and patient, until you meet your
father.&quot; The little boy knelt down and repeated the Lord's Prayer; and as he
said, &quot;Thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven,&quot; he felt calm and
happy as he used to do when he knelt at his mother's knee, and he thought her
hand was waving over him, as if to bless him. When he lifted up his head there
was no one there but himself; but he saw an old gray cross, and a <span class="smcap">Gold Thread</span> was tied to it, and passed away,
away, shining through the woods.</p>

<p>With a firm hold of his gold thread, the boy began his journey home. He
passed along path-ways on which the brown leaves of last year's growth were
thickly strewn, and from among which flowers of every colour were springing. He crossed little
brooks that ran like silver threads, and tinkled like silver bells. He passed
under trees with great trunks, and huge branches that swept down to the ground,
and waved far up in the blue sky. The birds hopped about him, and looked down
upon him from among the green leaves, and they sang him songs, and some of them
seemed to speak to him. He thought one large bird like a crow cried, &quot;Good boy!
good boy!&quot; and another whistled, &quot;Cheer up! cheer up!&quot; and so he went merrily
on, and very often he gave the robins and blackbirds that came near him bits of
his cake. After awhile, he came to a green spot in the middle of the wood,
without trees, and a footpath went direct across it, to the place where the gold
thread was leading him, and there he saw a sight that made him wonder and pause.
It was a bird about the size of a pigeon, with feathers like gold and a crown
like silver, and it was slowly walking near him, and he saw gold eggs glittering
in a nest among the grass a few yards off. Now, he thought, it would be such a nice thing to bring home
a nest with gold eggs! The bird did not seem afraid of him, but stopped and
looked at him with a calm blue eye, as if she said, &quot;Surely you would not rob
me?&quot; He could not, however, reach the nest with his hand, and though he pulled
and pulled the thread, it would not yield one inch, but seemed as stiff as a
wire. &quot;I see the thread quite plain,&quot; said the boy to himself, &quot;and the very
place where it enters the dark wood on the other side. I will just leap to the
nest, and in a moment I shall have the eggs in my pocket, and then spring back
and catch the thread again. I cannot lose it here, with the sun shining; and,
besides, I see it a long way before me.&quot; So he took one step to seize the eggs;
but he was in such haste that he fell and crushed the nest, breaking the eggs to
pieces, and the little bird screamed and flew away, and then suddenly the birds
in the trees began to fly about, and a large owl swept out of a dark glade, and
cried, &quot;Whoo&#8212;whoo&#8212;whoo-oo-oo;&quot; and a cloud came over the sun! Eric's heart beat quick, and he made a grasp at his gold thread,
but it was not there! Another, and another grasp, but it was not there! and soon
he saw it waving far above his head, like a gossamer thread in the breeze. You
would have pitied him, while you could not have helped being angry with him for
having been so silly and disobedient when thus tried, had you only seen his pale
face, as he looked above him for his thread, and about him for the road, but
could see neither! And he became so confused with his fall, that he did not know
which side of the open glade he had entered, nor to which point he was
travelling. But at last he thought he heard a bird chirping, &quot;Seek&#8212;seek&#8212;seek!&quot;
and another repeating, &quot;Try again&#8212;try again&#8212;try&#8212;try!&quot; and
then he remembered what the lady had said to him, and he fell on his knees and
told all his grief, and cried, &quot;Oh, give me back my thread! and help me never,
never, to let it go again!&quot; As he lifted up his eyes, he saw the thread come
slowly, slowly down; and when it came near, he sprang to it and caught it, and
he did not know whether to laugh, or cry, or sing, he was so thankful and happy!
&quot;Ah!&quot; said he, &quot;I hope I shall never forget this fall!&quot; That part of the Lord's
Prayer came into his mind which says, &quot;Lead us not into temptation, but deliver
us from evil.&quot; &quot;Who would have thought,&quot; said he to himself, &quot;that I was in any
danger in such a beautiful, green, sunny place as this, and so very early, too,
in my journey! Oh! shame upon me!&quot; As he proceeded with much more thought and
caution, a large crow up a tree was hoarsely croaking, and seemed to say,
&quot;Beware, beware!&quot; &quot;Thank you, Mr Crow,&quot; said the boy, &quot;I shall;&quot; and he threw
him a bit of bread for his good advice. But now the thread led him through the
strangest places. One was a very dark, deep ravine, with a stream that roared
and rushed far down, and overhead the rocks seemed to meet, and thick bushes
concealed the light, and nothing could Eric see but the gold thread, that looked
like a thread of fire, though even that grew dim sometimes, until he could only
feel it in his hand. And whither he was going he knew not. At one time he seemed
to be on the edge of a precipice, until it seemed as if the next step <em>must</em> lead him over, and plunge him down; but when he came to the very
edge, the thread led him quite safely along it. At another, a rock which looked
like a wall rose before him, and he said to himself, &quot;Well, I must be stopped
here! I shall never be able to climb up!&quot; But just as he touched it, he found
steps cut in it, and up, up, the thread guided him to the top! Then it would
bring him down, down, until he once stood beside a raging stream, and the water
foamed and dashed. &quot;Now,&quot; he thought, &quot;I must be drowned; but come what may, I
will not let my thread go.&quot; And so it was, that when he came so near the stream
as to feel the spray upon his cheek, and was sure that he must leap in if he
followed his thread, what did he see but a little bridge that passed from bank
to bank, and by which he crossed in perfect safety; until at last he began to
lose fear,
and to believe more and more that he would always be in the right road, so long
as he did not trust mere appearances, but kept hold of his thread!</p>

<h3 class="noc">THE GREAT LION&#8212;THE LITTLE SQUIRREL&#8212;AN OLD FRIEND&#8212;THE BLOODHOUND&#8212;THE LAST
TEMPTATION.</h3>
</div>

<p>But Eric had now to endure a great trial of his faith in the thread. As he
journeyed on, it led him up a winding path towards the summit of a hill. The
large trees of the forest were soon left behind, and small stunted bushes grew
among masses of gray rocks. The path was like the bed of a dry brook, and was
often very steep. There were no birds except little stone-chats, that hopped and
chirped among the large round
stones. Far below, he could see the tops of the trees, and here and there a
stream glittering under the sunbeams. Nothing disturbed the silence but the
hoarse croak of the raven, or the wild cry of a kite or eagle, that, like a
speck, wheeled far up in the sky. But suddenly, Eric heard a roar like thunder
coming from the direction towards which the thread was leading him. He stopped
for a moment, but the thread was firm in his hand, and led right up the hill. On
he went, and no wonder he started, when, as he turned the corner of a rock, he
heard another roar, and saw the head of a huge lion looking out of what seemed
to be a cave, a few yards back from the edge of a dizzy precipice! He saw, too,
that the path he must follow was between the lion's den and the precipice. What
now was to be done? Should he give up his thread and fly? No! A voice in his
heart encouraged him to be brave and not fear, and he knew from his experience
that he had always been led in safety and peace when he followed the road,
holding fast to his thread. He was certain that his father never would deceive him, or bid him do
anything but what was right; and he was sure, too, that the lady, from her love
to him, and her teaching him to trust God and to pray, would not have bid him do
anything that was wrong. And then an old verse his father taught him came into
his mind&#8212;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>
"In the darkest night, my child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Canst thou see the Right, my child?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Forward then! God is near!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">The Right will be light to thee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Armour and might to thee;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Forward! and never fear!"</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="figcenter" alt="Illustration 8" src="images/fig-08.jpg" width="400" height="571" />
</div>

<p>So Eric resolved to go on in faith. There was just one thing he saw which
cheered him, and that was a white hare, sitting with her ears cocked, quite
close to the lion's den, and he wondered how she had no fear, but he could not
explain it at the time. On he walked, but he could hardly breathe, as the thread
led still nearer and nearer to the den. These big eyes were glaring on him, and
seemed to draw him closer and closer! There the lion stood, on one side of the path, while the great precipice descended on the
other. One step more, and he was between these two dangers. He moved on until he
was so near that he seemed to feel the lion's breath, and then the brute sprang
out on him, and tried to strike him with his huge paw that would have crushed
him to the dust! Eric shut his eyes, and gave himself up for lost. But the lion
suddenly fell back, for he was held fast by a great iron chain, and so Eric
passed in safety!</p>

<p>Oh, how thankful he was! and how gladly he ran down hill, the lion in his den
roaring behind him! Down he ran until all was quiet again. As he pursued his
journey in the beautiful green woods, something told him his greatest trial was
past. He felt very peaceful and strong. And now, as he reached some noble old
beech-trees, the thread fell on the grass, and he took this as a sign that he
should lie down too, and so he did, grateful for the rest. He ate some of his
cake, and drank from a clear spring beside him, and feasted on wild strawberries
which grew in abundance all round him. He then stretched himself on his back
among soft moss, and looked up through the branches of the gigantic tree, and
saw with delight the sunlight speckling the emerald green leaves and brown bark
with touches of silver, and, far up, the deep blue sky with white clouds
reposing on it, like snowy islands on a blue ocean; and he watched the
squirrels, with their bushy tails, as they ran up the tree, and jumped from
branch to branch, and sported among the leaves, until he fell into a sort of
pleasant day-dream, and felt so happy, he hardly knew why. As he lay here, he
thought he heard, in his half-waking dream, a little squirrel sing a song. Was
it not his own heart, now so glad because doing what was right, which was
singing? This was the song which he thought he heard:&#8212;</p>

<div class="verse">

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or wrapp'd about my throat!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Ha, ha, ha! ha, ha, ha! ha, ha, ha!"</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>As Eric opened his eyes, and looked up, he saw a little squirrel with its
tail curling up its back, sitting on a branch looking down upon him; and then it
playfully ran away with the tail down and waving after it. &quot;Farewell, happy
little fellow!&quot; said Eric; &quot;I must do my work now, and play like you
afterwards;&quot; for at that moment the thread again became tight, and Eric,
refreshed with his rest, and hearty for his journey, stepped out bravely. He
saw, at some distance, and beyond an open glade in the forest, a rapid river
towards which he was descending. When near the river, he perceived something
struggling in the water, and then heard a loud cry or scream for help, as if
from one drowning. He was almost tempted to run off to his assistance without his thread, but he felt thankful that the thread itself
led in the very direction from whence he heard the cries coming. So off he ran
as fast as he could, and as he came to the brink of a deep, dark pool in the
river, he saw the head of a boy rising above the water, as the poor little
fellow tried to keep himself afloat. Now he sank&#8212;again he rose&#8212;until he suddenly
disappeared. Eric laid hold of his thread with a firm hand, and leaped in over
head and ears, and then rose to the surface, and with his other hand swam to
where the boy had sank. He soon caught him, and brought him with great
difficulty to the surface, which he never could have done unless the thread had
supported them both above the water.</p>

<p>&quot;Eric!&quot; cried the gasping boy, opening his eyes, almost covered by his long,
wet hair. &quot;Wolf!&quot; cried Eric, &quot;is it you?&quot; It was indeed poor Wolf, who lay
panting on the dry land, with his rough garments dripping with water, and
himself hardly able to move. &quot;Oh, tell me, Wolf, what brought you here! I am so glad to have helped you!&quot;
After a little time, when Wolf could speak, he told him in his own way, bit by
bit, how Ralph had suspected him; and how the old woman had heard him speaking
as she was looking out of an upper window; and how when Ralph asked the gold
belt he could not give it; and how he was obliged himself to fly; and how he had
been running for his life for hours. &quot;Now let us fly,&quot; said Wolf; &quot;I am quite
strong again. I fear that they are in pursuit of us.&quot;</p>

<p>They both went on at a quick pace, Eric having shewn Wolf the wonderful
thread, and explained to him how he must never part with it, come what may, and
having also given him a bit of his cake to comfort him. &quot;O rub-a-dub, dub!&quot; said
Wolf, squeezing the water out of his hair, as he trotted along; &quot;I am glad to be
away. Ralph would have killed me like a pig. The voice told me to run after
you.&quot; So on they went together, happy again to meet. Suddenly Wolf stopped, and
listening with anxious
face, he said, &quot;Hark! did you hear anything?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said Eric, &quot;what was it?&quot;
&quot;Hush!&#8212;listen!&#8212;there again&#8212;I hear it!&quot; &quot;I think I do hear something far off like
a dog's bark,&quot; replied Eric. &quot;Hark!&quot; So they both stopped and listened, and far
away they heard a deep &quot;Bow-wow-wow-wow-o-o-o-o-o&quot; echoing through the forest.
&quot;Let us run as fast as we can,&quot; said the boy, in evident fear; &quot;hear him!&#8212;hear
him!&quot; &quot;Bow-wow-wow-o-o-o-o,&quot; and the sound came nearer and nearer. &quot;What is it?
why are you so afraid?&quot; inquired Eric. &quot;Oh! that is Ralph's bloodhound, Tuscar,&quot;
cried Wolf, &quot;and he is following us. He won't perhaps touch me, but you he may.&quot;
So Eric ran as fast as he could, but never let go the gold thread, which this
time led towards a steep hill, which they were obliged to scramble up. &quot;Run,
Eric!&#8212;quick&#8212;hide&#8212;up a tree&#8212;anywhere!&quot; &quot;I cannot, I dare not,&quot; said Eric;
&quot;whatever happens, I must hold fast my thread.&quot; But they heard the
&quot;Bow-wow-o-o-o&quot; coming nearer and nearer, and as they looked back they saw the large hound rush out of the wood, and as he came to the
water, catching sight of the boys on the opposite hill, he leaped in, and in a
few minutes would be near them. And now he came bellowing like a fierce bull up
the hill, his tongue hanging out, and his nose tracking along the ground, as he
followed their footsteps. &quot;I shall run and meet him,&quot; said Wolf, &quot;and stop him
if I can;&quot; and down ran the swineherd, calling, &quot;Tuscar! Tuscar! good dog,
Tuscar!&quot; Tuscar knew Wolf, and passed him, but ran up to Eric. As he reached
Eric, who stood calm and firm, the bloodhound stopped, panting, smelling his
clothes all round, but, strange to say, wagging his huge tail! He then ran back
the way he had come, as if he had made a mistake, and all his race was for
nothing! How was this? Ah, poor Tuscar remembered the supper Eric had given him,
and was grateful for his kindness!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="figcenter" alt="Illustration 9" src="images/fig-09.jpg" width="400" height="557" />
</div>

<p>Wolf was astonished at Eric's escape, until he heard how he and Tuscar had
become acquainted; and then Wolf heard the voice in his heart say that there was nothing better than kindness and love shewn
to man or beast. They both after this pursued their journey with light and
hopeful hearts, for they had got out of what was called the wild robber country,
and Eric knew that he was drawing near home. The thread was stronger than ever,
and every hour it helped more and more to support him. Wolf trotted along with
his short stick, and sometimes snorting and blowing with the fatigue like one of
his own pigs. They talked as best they could about all they had seen. &quot;Did you
see big Thorold the lion?&quot; asked Wolf. &quot;I did,&quot; said Eric; &quot;he is very awful,
but he was chained.&quot; &quot;Lucky for you!&quot; said Wolf, &quot;for Ralph hunts with him and
kills travellers. He will obey none but Ralph. I heard him roaring. He is
hungry. He once ate one of my pigs, and would have ate me if he had not first
caught the poor black porker. I escaped up a tree.&quot; And thus they chatted, as
they journeyed on through woods, and across green plains, and over low hills,
until Wolf complained of hunger. Eric at once gave him what remained of his
large cake; but it did not suffice to appease the hunger of the herd, who was,
however, very thankful for what he got. To their delight they now saw a
beautiful cottage not far from their path, and, as they approached it, an old
woman, with a pretty girl who seemed to be her daughter, came out to meet them.
&quot;Good day, young gentlemen!&quot; said the old woman with a kind smile and a
courtesy; &quot;you seem to be on your travels, and look wearied? Pray come into my
cottage, and I shall refresh you.&quot; &quot;What fortunate fellows we are!&quot; said Wolf.
&quot;We are much obliged to you for your hospitality,&quot; replied Eric. But, alas! the
thread drew him in an opposite direction; so turning to Wolf, he said, &quot;I cannot
go in.&quot; &quot;Come, my handsome young gentleman,&quot; said the young woman, &quot;and we shall
make you so happy. You shall have such a dinner as will delight you, I am sure;
and you may remain as long as you please, and I will dance and sing to you; nor
need you pay anything.&quot; And she came forward smiling and dancing, offering her
arm to Eric. &quot;Surely you won't be so rude as refuse me! you are so beautiful,
and have such lovely hair and eyes, and I never saw such a belt as you wear: do
come!&quot; &quot;Come, my son,&quot; said the old woman to Wolf, as she put her hand round his
neck. &quot;With all my heart!&quot; replied Wolf; &quot;for, to tell the truth, I am wearied
and hungry; one does not get such offers as yours every day.&quot; &quot;I cannot go,&quot;
again said Eric. <em>They</em> could not see the thread, for to some it was
invisible; but <em>he</em> saw it, and felt it like a wire passing away from the
cottage. &quot;Who are you, kind friends?&quot; inquired Eric. &quot;Friends of the king and of
his family. Honest subjects, good people,&quot; said the old woman. &quot;Do you know
Prince Eric?&quot; asked Wolf. &quot;Right well!&quot; replied the young woman. &quot;He is a great
friend of mine; a fine, tall, comely youth. He calls me his own little
sweetheart.&quot; &quot;It is false!&quot; said Eric; &quot;you do not know him. You should not
lie.&quot; But he did not tell her who he was, neither did Wolf, for Eric had made a
sign to him to be silent. &quot;I won't enter your dwelling,&quot; said Eric, &quot;for my duty
calls me away.&quot; They both gave a loud laugh, and said, &quot;Hear him! Only hear a
fine young fellow talking about duty! Pleasure, ease, and liberty are for the
young. We only want to make you happy: come!&quot; &quot;I shall go with you,&quot; said Wolf;
&quot;do come, Eric.&quot; &quot;Wolf, speak to me,&quot; whispered Eric to the swineherd. &quot;You know
<em>I</em> cannot go, for my duty tells me
to follow the thread. But now I see that this is the house of the wicked, for
you heard how they lied; they neither know the king nor his children; and they
laugh too at duty. Be advised, Wolf, and follow me.&quot; Wolf hesitated, and looked
displeased. &quot;Only for an hour, Eric!&quot; &quot;Not a minute. Wolf. If you trust them
more than me, go; but I am sure you and I shall never meet again.&quot; &quot;Then I will
trust you, Eric,&quot; said Wolf; &quot;the voice in my heart tells me to do so.&quot; And so
they both passed on. But the old woman and the girl began to abuse them, and
call them all manner of evil names, and to laugh at them as silly fellows. The
girl threw
stones at them, which made Wolf turn round and flourish his stick over his head.
At last they entered the cottage, the old woman shaking her fist, and calling
out from the door, &quot;I'll soon send my friend Ralph after you!&quot; &quot;Oh, ho! is that
the way the wind blows!&quot; exclaimed Wolf, with a whistle; and, grasping Eric's
arm, said, &quot;You were right, prince! I never suspected them. I see now they are
bad.&quot; &quot;I saw that before,&quot; replied Eric, &quot;and knew that no good would come to us
from making their acquaintance.&quot; &quot;Were they not cunning?&quot; &quot;Yes; but, probably,
with all their smiles, flattery, and fair promises, they would have proved more
cruel in the end than either Ralph or old Thorold.&quot; &quot;What would they have done
to us? Why did they meet us? Who are they, think you?&quot; &quot;I don't know, Wolf; it
was enough for me that they lied, and did not wish us to do what was right. The
gold thread given me by my father never could have led me into the society and
house of the wicked. I am glad we held it fast.&quot;</p>

<h3 class="pl mb2">THE GREEN ISLAND OF THE LAKE, AND THE RETURN HOME.</h3>
</div></div>

<p>Not long after this strange adventure, they reached a rising ground, from
which a magnificent view burst upon them. Below, there was a large lake,
surrounded by wooded hills, above which rose noble rocks fringed with stately
pines, and higher ranges of mountains beyond, some of whose summits were covered
with snow
that glittered like purest alabaster in the azure blue of the sky. Eric gave a
cry of joy; for he saw the house of one of his father's foresters, which he had
once visited with his father. &quot;Wolf! Wolf!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;look yonder, that is
the house of Darkeye, the forester. We are safe!&quot; and the thread was leading
straight down in the very direction which they wished. Darkeye's house was built
on a small green island in the lake. The island was like a little fort, for on
every side the rocks descended like a wall. It could only be approached by a
boat, which Darkeye kept on the island, and then by a narrow stair cut out of
the rock at the landing-place. No robbers could thus get near it, and Darkeye
was there to give shelter to travellers, and to help any of the poor who had to
pass that way. The thread led down to the shore. They forgot their fatigue, and
ran down till they reached the ferry. &quot;Boat, ahoy!&quot; shouted Eric. By and by two
boys were seen running out of the cottage, and after looking cautiously at those
who were calling
for the boat, they rowed off, and soon were at the shore, where stood Eric with
his gold belt, and Wolf in his rough skins. &quot;Olaf! Torquil! don't you remember
me?&quot; asked Eric, looking at his old friends. The boys looked astonished as they
recognised the young prince, and received him joyfully into their boat, he
holding by the thread, which seemed to cross the ferry towards the cottage. How
many questions were mutually put and answered in a few minutes! They told him
their father was at home; and how he had lately seen the king; and how the king
was anxiously looking for Eric's return; and how glad all on the island would be
to see him; and the younger boy, Torquil, told him how they had now a tame
otter, that fished in the lake, and a fine golden eagle which they had got young
in her nest, that also lived on the island with them; and how their mother had
got another baby since he had been there, and how happy they all were, and so
on, until they arrived at the island, and there was old Darkeye himself waiting
to receive them; and when he saw who was in the boat, he ran down the stone steps and grasped
the young prince's hand, and drew him to his heart. &quot;Welcome! welcome!&quot; said he;
&quot;I knew you had been in the forest, but your father would not tell me anything
more about you. He only said that he longed for your coming home. But who is
this?&quot; asked Darkeye, pointing to Wolf. &quot;A friend of mine,&quot; said Eric, with a
smile. &quot;My name is Wolf,&quot; grunted the swineherd. &quot;I think I have seen him
before. But no! What? Yes!&quot; said Darkeye, examining him; then added, as if
he had discovered some old acquaintance, &quot;Surely I <em>have</em> seen him. Tell me, my
fine fellow, did you&quot;&#8212;&#8212; It was evident Darkeye had seen Wolf killing his game,
or in some affray with the robbers. Wolf looked sternly at Darkeye, then at
Eric, but said nothing. &quot;Oh, Darkeye, do not trouble poor Wolf,&quot; said Eric, &quot;but
let him go into the cottage; and come you with me, as I wish to tell you all
that has happened to me during these few days.&quot; So, while the boys took Wolf to
the cottage, and food was being prepared, Eric told Darkeye all his adventures; and you would
have been sure that the forester was hearing something which surprised and
interested him wonderfully, had you seen his face, and how he sometimes laughed,
or knit his brows and looked angry, or sad and solemn, or sprung to his feet
from the rock on which he was sitting beside Eric. When Eric came to speak about
the old woman and her daughter, &quot;Ah!&quot; said Darkeye, &quot;there are not worse people
in that wicked country! They say that the old woman is a witch of some kind. But
whether she poisons travellers or drowns them, I know not. No doubt she is in
league with Ralph the robber, and would have robbed you or kept you fast in some
way or other till you were handed over to him. You were right, my prince, in all
you did. The only way of being delivered from temptation is to be brave, and do
what is right, come what may.&quot; Then, grasping Eric by the hand, he led him back
to the cottage. There Darkeye's wife received him like a mother, and all the
children gathered round him in surprise and admiration, he looked so brave and lovely.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="figcenter" alt="Illustration 11" src="images/fig-11.jpg" width="400" height="507" />
</div>

<p>One of the walls of the cottage was reared on the edge of the rock, so that
it seemed a continuation of it, and to rise up from the deep waters of the lake.
The boys were thus able often to fish with a long line out of the window. A
winding-stair led to a look-out on the roof, from which the whole island, called
&quot;The Green Island of the Lake,&quot; could be seen. It was about a mile or more in
circumference, and was dotted all over with the cottages of the other foresters
and king's huntsmen, each surrounded with clumps of trees, through which the
curling smoke from the chimneys might be seen ascending. There were everywhere
beautifully-kept gardens, with fruits, and flowers, and bee-hives; and fields,
too, with their crops. On the green knolls and in the little valleys might be
seen cows and sheep; while flocks of goats browsed among ivy-covered rocks. In
the middle of the island was a little shallow lake, beside which the otter had
his house among the rocks; and there the eagle also lived. All the children in the island were the
best of friends, and they played together, and sailed their boats on the little
lake, and every day met in the house of one of the foresters to learn their
lessons; and on Sunday, as they were very far away from any church, old Darkeye
used to read the Good Book to them, and worship with them, and did all he could
to make them love God and one another. There was also in the island a house,
where, by the king's orders, all poor travellers could find refuge and
refreshment. And it was a great pleasure to the boys and girls to visit them;
and if they were sick and confined to bed, to attend to their wants. If the
stranger had any children, the young islanders always shared their sports with
them. And nothing pleased these stranger children more than to get leave to sail
a boat, or to have the loan of a fishing-rod, or to hear the boys call Oscar,
for that was the name of the otter, out of his den, and to play with Tor the
eagle; or to see them feed Oscar with some of the fish they had caught, and Tor
with a bit of
meat. The dogs were so friendly, too, that they never touched Oscar, but would
swim about in the same pool with him. And so all were happy in the Green Island;
because Darkeye had taught them what a wicked thing selfishness was, and that
the only way to be happy was by thinking about others as well as themselves, and
by becoming like Him, the Elder Brother of us all, who &quot;pleased not Himself.&quot; He
also used to say: &quot;Now, when you work, work like men, and when you play, play
like boys: be hearty at both.&quot; And so, while there was no idleness, there was
abundance of recreation. Another evil was never permitted on the island, and
that was, disobedience to parents, or want of respect to the old. But, indeed,
punishment for these offences was seldom needed. The young learned to <em>like</em> to
do what was right, and were too brave and manly to give pain and trouble to
others, by forcing them to find fault or to punish. I should have mentioned,
also, that they had a little band of musicians. One beat the drum, a few played
the fife, and others
some simple instrument; while almost all could sing tolerably well in parts.
Thus, many a traveller would pause and listen with delight, as he heard, on a
summer's evening, the chorus sung from many voices, or the music from the band
coming from the island. &quot;Young people,&quot; Darkeye used to say, &quot;have much wealth
and happiness given them, for themselves and others, if they only used their
gifts.&quot;</p>

<p>But I am forgetting Eric and Wolf. They were both, you may be sure, ready for
their dinner, and there was laid for them on a table, cream, cakes, and fresh
trout, and such other good things as the kind woman could get ready.</p>

<p>But now the thread began to move, as if it wished Eric to move also. Before
rising to depart, he told Wolf how Darkeye, for his sake, would be so glad to
take care of him, until he got his father's permission to bring him into the
castle; that he would learn to be a huntsman, and be taught what was good, and
to know about the Voice that spoke in his heart; and that all the boys in the
island would make him their friend if he did what was right. &quot;Ralph will come here!&quot;
said Wolf, hanging his head. &quot;I wish the rascal did,&quot; said Darkeye, &quot;for he
would never go back. But he cannot enter my fort, and knows me and my huntsmen
too well ever to try it. I have had more than one brush with the villain, and we
hope soon to drive him and his brood from their bloody nest. Wolf, you are
welcome and safe, for Eric's sake!&quot; Then turning to Eric, he said, &quot;I shall
teach him, and make a man of him, my young prince, depend upon it. And now,
before we part, I have to ask a favour,&quot; continued Darkeye. &quot;You know our custom
near evening? If the thread permits, remain, and be one of us.&quot; &quot;I remember it,&quot;
said Eric, &quot;and will remain and be one of you, and let poor Wolf also be one.&quot;
And so they entered the cottage, and all sat down round an open window which
looked out upon the beautiful lake with its wooded islands, and surrounded by
the noble forest, above which rose the giant peaks and precipices. The water was
calm as glass, and reflected every brilliant colour from rock and tree, and, most of all, from the golden clouds,
which already began to gather in the west. Darkeye read from the Good Book of
one who had left his father's house, and went to a far country, where he would
fain have satisfied his hunger from the husks which the swine did eat, and could
not, but who at last returned home after having suffered from his disobedience.
When he closed the book, all stood up and sung these words with sweet and happy
voices:&#8212;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>
"Father! from Thy throne above,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Bless our lowly home below!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Jesus, Shepherd! in Thy love,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Guard Thy flock from every foe.</span><br />
<br />
"Thine we are! for Thou hast made us;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Thine, for we're redeem'd by Thee;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Thine, for Thou hast ever led us,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Thine, we evermore shall be!</span><br />
<br />
"May we love Thee, may we fear Thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">May Thy will, not ours, be done,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Never leave us till we're near Thee</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In the Home where all are one!"</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Then they knelt down, and Darkeye spoke to God in name of them all, thanking Him for His goodness, and
telling Him their wants. When they rose from their knees, the gold thread shone
brilliantly, and, like a beam of light, passed out at the door in the direction
of the ferry. During the singing of the verses, Wolf seemed for the first time
quite overcome. He bent his head, and covered his face with his hands. He then
said, in a low voice, when the short service was over, and as if speaking to
himself, while all were silent listening to him, &quot;I had a dream. Long, long ago.
A carriage&#8212;a lady. She was on her knees, with her hands clasped, and speaking to
the sky. She had hold of me. Ralph was there and the robbers. I forget the
rest.&quot; He rose and looked out of the window, gazing vacantly. &quot;What can he
mean?&quot; asked Eric aside to Darkeye, who was looking tenderly on Wolf. &quot;Ah! who
knows, poor boy! Singing always touches the heart of these wanderers.
Perhaps&#8212;yes&#8212;it may be,&quot; he said, so that Eric alone could hear him, &quot;that he has
been taken when a child by Ralph from some rich traveller, and perhaps his mother was killed! He may have been the child of
good people. Was that person his mother who, he says, prayed for him? If so, her
prayers are now answered, for her boy will be delivered,&#8212;poor Wolf! Wolf, my
boy,&quot; said Darkeye, &quot;come and bid farewell to your friend.&quot; Wolf started as from
a dream, and came to Eric. &quot;Farewell, my kind Wolf, and I hope to see you some
day in my father's house.&quot; The herd spoke not a word, but wiped his eyes with
the back of his rough hand. &quot;Cheer up, Wolf, for you will be good and happy
here.&quot; &quot;Wolf is happy already, and he will take care of the pigs, or do anything
for you all.&quot; He then held out his stick to Eric, and said, &quot;Take it; keep it
for my sake; it is all Wolf has to give; Ralph has the gold coin.&quot; &quot;Thank you,
good Wolf; but you will require it, and I need nothing to remember you.&quot; &quot;Don't
be angry, Eric, for what I did to you in the forest when we first met. My heart
is sorry.&quot; &quot;We did not know one another then, Wolf, and I shall never forget
that it is to you
I owe my escape.&quot; &quot;Wolf loves you, and every one here.&quot; &quot;I am sure you do, Wolf,
and I love you. God bless you, Wolf, I must go; farewell!&quot; And thus they parted.
But all gathered round Eric, and accompanied him to the boat, blessing the
little prince, and wishing him a peaceful and happy journey. Eric thanked them
with many smiles and tender words. Darkeye alone went with him into the boat,
wondering greatly at the thread, and most of all at the prince, who shone with a
beauty that seemed not of this world. The prince landed, but Darkeye knew, for
many reasons, that he could not accompany him in his journey, which he must take
alone. Eric embraced Darkeye, and waving his hand to all on the island, he was
soon lost to their sight in the great forest.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>
A winding pathway, over the ridge of hills, led down to a broad and rapid but
smooth river, and on its banks was a royal boat, splendid and rich to look upon.
She was white as snow, with a purple seat at the end covered by a canopy, that
gleamed with golden tassels and many gems. The thread led into the boat, and though no one was there,
Eric entered, and sat on a purple cushion, on which the Gold Thread also laid
itself down. No sooner had he gone on board of the boat, than&#8212;as if his little
foot, when it touched her, had sent her from the shore&#8212;she slowly moved into the
centre of the channel, and was carried downwards by the current. On she swept on
the bosom of that clear stream, between shores adorned with all that could
delight the eye&#8212;rocks and trees and flowers, with here and there foaming
waterfalls, from mountain rivulets which poured themselves into the great river.
The woods were full of song, and birds with splendid plumage flashed amidst the
foliage like rainbow hues amidst the clouds. Eric knew not whither he was being
carried, but his heart was sunshine and peace. On and on he swept with the
winding stream, until at last, darting under a dark archway of rock, and then
emerging into light, the boat grounded on a shore of pure white sand, while the
thread rose and led him to the land. No sooner had he stepped on shore and ascended the green bank, than
he found himself at the end of a long broad avenue of splendid old trees, whose
tops met overhead. The far-off end of the avenue was closed by a great marble
staircase, which ascended to a magnificent castle. Wall rose above wall, and
tower over tower. He saw grand flights of stairs, leading from one stately
terrace to another, with marble statues, clear gushing fountains, and
flower-gardens, and every kind of lovely tree. It was his father's castle at
last! He ran on with breathless anxiety and joy. He soon reached a large gate,
that seemed to be covered with glittering gold. As he looked at it, he saw the
thread tied to a golden knocker upon it, shaped like the old cross in the
forest. Inscribed over the gate were the words, &quot;He that persevereth to the end
shall be saved.&quot; He seized the knocker, and the moment it fell, the thread broke
and vanished like a flash of light. A crash of music was then heard. The door
opened, and there, in the midst of a court paved with marble of purest white, and on a golden throne, sat Eric's father,
surrounded by his brothers and sisters. The beautiful lady was there too, and
many, many more to welcome Eric. His father clasped him to his heart, and said,
&quot;My son was lost, but is found!&quot; While all crowded round Eric to bid him
welcome, with his weary feet and torn dress, kept together by the golden band, a
chorus was heard singing,&#8212;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>
"Home where the weary rest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Home where the good are blest,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Home of the soul;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Glorious the race when run,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Glorious the prize when won,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Glorious the goal!"</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Then there rose a swell of many young voices singing,&#8212;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>&quot;Oh, be joyful, be joyful, let every voice sing!<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Welcome, brothers, our brother, the son of the king;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">His wanderings are past, to his father he's come;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Little Eric, our darling, we welcome thee home!</span><br /></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p>&quot;Oh, bless'd is the true one who follows the road,<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Holding fast to his</span> <span class="smcap">gold thread of duty to God</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Who, when tempted, is firm, who in danger is brave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Who, forgetting himself, will a lost brother save.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Then be joyful, be joyful, for Eric is come;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;"> Little Eric, our darling, we welcome thee home!&quot;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>And then the sun set, and the earth was dark, but the palace of the king
shone like an aurora in the wintry sky.</p>
